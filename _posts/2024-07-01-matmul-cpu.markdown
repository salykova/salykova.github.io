title:  "Beating NumPy's Matrix Multiplication in 150 lines of C code"
excerpt: "In this step by step tutorial we'll optimize matrix multiplication on CPU in C achieving over 1 TFLOPS on an 8-core Ryzen 7 7700. The final optimized implementation is just 150 LOC and outperforms both OpenBLAS and MKL on Ryzen 7 7700. High-performance GEMM on CPU. Fast SGEMM in C. High-performance matrix multiplication on CPU. SGEMM Optimization on CPU."
